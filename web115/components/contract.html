<h2>Contract</h2>
<p>
  I, <a href="introduction.html">Jordan A. Perez</a>, agree to abide by the
  terms in my FA25 WEB115-N801 Web Markup and Scripting course with my
  instructor, Prof. D.I. von Briesen.
</p>
<p>
  I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will
  be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is
  inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
</p>
<p>
  I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or
  showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as
  absences.
</p>
